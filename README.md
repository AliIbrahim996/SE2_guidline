## Composer

* * *
   Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
   Composer is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project. By default, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency manager. It does however support a "global" project for convenience via the global command.

- **Download and run** [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)-it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed. just hit next.
\
&nbsp;

\
&nbsp;
- Now, **choose the command-line `PHP` path** you want to use, checkmark the box to add the PHP path, and click Next.
\
&nbsp;

\
&nbsp;
- Composer setup pop-up a screen that provides an option to use a `proxy` server to connect to the internet. If you want to use a proxy server, checkmark the box and enter the proxy URL; if not, leave it and click on the Next We are skipping this as we are not using any proxy server to connect internet.
\

## Laravel

* * *
  Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.

  Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.

  Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.

### Why Laravel?

  There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.

#### A Progressive Framework

  We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.

  If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise workloads.

#### A Scalable Framework

  Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.

  Need extreme scaling? Platforms like Laravel Vapor allow you to run your Laravel application at a nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.

#### A Community Framework

  Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer-friendly framework available. In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have contributed to the framework. Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.

### How to install laravel?

- Open Command-Prompt as an administrator and run this command in order to install `laravel installer` as a global `composer` dependency:
  
  ```sh
    composer global require laravel/installer
  ```

- **Install vs code extensions**
  - Laravel Extension Pack is a collection of extensions for Laravel development.

## PhpStorm (optional)

  `PhpStorm` is perfect for working with Symfony, Laravel, Drupal, WordPress, Zend Framework, Magento, Joomla!, CakePHP, Yii, and other frameworks.The editor actually 'gets' your code and deeply understands its structure, supporting all the PHP language features for modern and legacy projects. It provides the best code completion, refactorings, on-the-fly error prevention, and more.
  If you have a good pc/ laptop hardware you can download and install it insted of `Vs code`.
